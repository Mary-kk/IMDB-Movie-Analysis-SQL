# IMDB Movie Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes IMDB movie data using SQL to derive insights about movie ratings, genres, revenue, and trends. I performed thorough data cleaning, including the removal of duplicates, standardization of values, and handling of missing data, to ensure high-quality, reliable results. The analysis answers key questions about movie performance and predicts future trends in the film industry.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **dataset.csv**: The raw IMDB movie dataset used for analysis.
- **analysis.sql**: SQL queries used for data analysis and to answer the key questions.
- **insights.md**: Summary of insights derived from running the queries, with an explanation of the findings.
- **visualization.png** (optional): Visual representations (e.g., charts, graphs) of the analysis results.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Removed duplicates**
- **standardization of values**
- **handled missing data**

## Key Analysis Performed
After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I performed a series of SQL queries to uncover actionable insights. The key analysis questions I answered included:
